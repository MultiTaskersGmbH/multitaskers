          justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or

          will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
        <h3>
          General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
          website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
          data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
          special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
          DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
          data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
          (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the
          access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
          fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect;
          25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
          required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation
          of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
          fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on
          the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
          Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
          provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries
        </h3>
        <p>
          Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United
          States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU
          countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may
          potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
          processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
          protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
          guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
          release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
          subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in
          court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
          Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
          personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these
          processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
          to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
          you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the
          lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
          revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
          object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
          (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
          OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
          SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
          PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
          DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
          LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
          DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
          INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
          THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
          PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
          ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
          AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY
          TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS
          AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
          DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
          log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
          state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
          the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
          complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
          proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
          you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller,
          this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
          right to demand information about your archived personal data, their
          source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your
          data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data
          rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
          matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
          hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
          the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
          contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
          applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
            archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
            During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the
            right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
            unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
            the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of
            this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
            exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of its eradication.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
            rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
            long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
            the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving &ndash; may be
          processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend
          legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
          or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
          the European Union or a member state of the EU.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
          website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
          the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
          &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
          the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Encrypted payment transactions on this website</h3>
        <p>
          If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g.
          account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank
          account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with
          us, this information is required to process payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard,
          debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted
          SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
          checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
          &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the
          appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be
          able to read the payment information you share with us.
        </p>
        <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
        <p>
          We herewith object to the use of contact information published in
          conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site
          Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have
          not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages
          reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the
          unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM
          messages.

        <h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
        <h3>Contact form</h3>
        <p>
          If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information
          provided in the contact form as well as any contact information
          provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry
          and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share
          this information without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your
          request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is
          necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases
          the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
          processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on
          your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the
          consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain
          with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to
          the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is
          being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our
          response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any
          mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.
        </p>
        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
          all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and
          processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not
          pass these data on without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
          inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for
          the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
          data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the
          effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
          on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been
          obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until
          you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
          purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
          request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
          retention periods - remain unaffected.

        <p>
          The communication is encrypted end-to-end (peer-to-peer), which
          prevents WhatsApp or other third parties from gaining access to the
          communication content. However, WhatsApp does gain access to metadata
          created during the communication process (for example, sender,
          recipient, and time). We would also like to point out that WhatsApp
          has stated that it shares personal data of its users with its
          U.S.-based parent company Meta. Further details on data processing can
          be found in the WhatsApp privacy policy at:{" "}

        <p>
          The use of WhatsApp is based on our legitimate interest in
          communicating as quickly and effectively as possible with customers,
          interested parties and other business and contractual partners (Art.
          6(1)(f) GDPR). If a corresponding consent has been requested, data
          processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of the consent;
          this consent may be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The communication content exchanged between and on WhatsApp remains
          with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to
          storage or the purpose for which the data is stored ceases to apply
          (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal
          provisions, in particular retention periods, remain unaffected.

        <p>We use WhatsApp in the &ldquo;WhatsApp Business&rdquo; variant.</p>

        <h3>Processing of Customer and Contract Data</h3>
        <p>
          We collect, process, and use personal customer and contract data for
          the establishment, content arrangement and modification of our
          contractual relationships. Data with personal references to the use of
          this website (usage data) will be collected, processed, and used only
          if this is necessary to enable the user to use our services or
          required for billing purposes. The legal basis for these processes is
          Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collected customer data shall be deleted upon completion of the
          order or termination of the business relationship and upon expiration
          of any existing statutory archiving periods. This shall be without
          prejudice to any statutory archiving periods.

        <h3>
          Data transfer upon closing of contracts for services and digital
          content
        </h3>
        <p>
          We share personal data with third parties only if this is necessary in
          conjunction with the handling of the contract; for instance, with the
          financial institution tasked with the processing of payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any further transfer of data shall not occur or shall only occur if
          you have expressly consented to the transfer. Any sharing of your data
          with third parties in the absence of your express consent, for
          instance for advertising purposes, shall not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basis for the processing of data is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which
          permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or for
          pre-contractual actions.
        </p>
        <h3>Payment services</h3>
        <p>
          We integrate payment services of third-party companies on our website.
          When you make a purchase from us, your payment data (e.g. name,
          payment amount, bank account details, credit card number) are
          processed by the payment service provider for the purpose of payment
          processing. For these transactions, the respective contractual and
          data protection provisions of the respective providers apply. The use
          of the payment service providers is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR
          (contract processing) and in the interest of a smooth, convenient, and
          secure payment transaction (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). Insofar as your
          consent is requested for certain actions, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR is the
          legal basis for data processing; consent may be revoked at any time
          for the future.

        <h2>6. Online-based Audio and Video Conferences (Conference tools)</h2>
        <h4>Data processing</h4>
        <p>
          We use online conference tools, among other things, for communication
          with our customers. The tools we use are listed in detail below. If
          you communicate with us by video or audio conference using the
          Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by the
          provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The conferencing
          tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools
          (email address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference
          tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of
          participation in the conference, number of participants and other
          &ldquo;context information&rdquo; related to the communication process
          (metadata).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data
          required for the processing of the online communication. This
          includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
          device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera
          type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available
          within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
          provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
          recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
          videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while using
          the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
          processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are largely
          determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further
          information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in
          the data protection declarations of the tools used, and which we have
          listed below this text.
        </p>
        <h4>Purpose and legal bases</h4>
        <p>
          The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or
          existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
          customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools
          serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us or
          our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
          Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question will be
          used on the basis of this consent; the consent may be revoked at any
          time with effect from that date.
        </p>
        <h4>Duration of storage</h4>
        <p>
          Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will
          be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us to delete
          it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data
          no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you
          delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that is
          stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own
          purposes. For details, please directly contact the operators of the
          conference tools.

        <h4>Data processing</h4>
        <p>
          We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the
          above-mentioned service. This is a contract mandated by data privacy
          laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website
          visitors only based on our instructions and in compliance with the
          GDPR.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Custom Services</h2>
        <h3>Handling applicant data</h3>
        <p>
          We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications
          to us (e.g., via e-mail, via postal services on by submitting the
          online job application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope,
          purpose and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction
          with the application process. We assure you that the collection,
          processing, and use of your data will occur in compliance with the
          applicable data privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and
          that your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.
        </p>
        <h4>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</h4>
        <p>
          If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated
          personal data (e.g., contact and communications data, application
          documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are
          required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an
          employment relationship. The legal grounds for the aforementioned are
          &sect; 26 BDSG according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment
          Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and
          &ndash; provided you have given us your consent &ndash; Art. 6(1)(a)
          GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our
          company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who
          are involved in the processing of your job application.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data
          you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of &sect; 26 BDSG
          and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment
          relationship in our data processing system.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Archiving Period</h4>
        <p>
          If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or
          withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you
          have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)
          GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure
          (rejection or withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will
          be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed.
          The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal
          dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the
          expiry of the 6-month period (e.g., due to an impending or pending
          legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for
          further storage no longer applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement
          (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements
          preclude the deletion.
        </p>
        <h4>Admission to the applicant pool</h4>
        <p>
          If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our
          applicant pool. In case of admission, all documents and information
          from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool in
          order to contact you in case of suitable vacancies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express
          agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). The submission agreement is voluntary
          and has no relation to the ongoing application procedure.{" "}
          <strong>
            The affected person can revoke his agreement at any time.
          </strong>{" "}
          In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably
          deleted, provided there are no legal reasons for storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later
          than two years after consent has been granted.
