      "Q1": {
        "question": "1.1 Why does it take so long to learn a language?",
        "answer1": "Each level consists of a huge number of vocabulary and grammar topics that you have to work on and learn to apply in practice (in real life outside the language school). Mastery of a foreign language is a skill and can only be developed, which takes a lot of time. It is not enough to just read some information - you can do it in a couple of hours. The main thing is to learn how to apply the acquired knowledge in real life.",
        "answer2": "Skills are not formed quickly, but are the result of time-consuming work and lots of effort on behalf of both the teacher and the student. Many students expect instant results, but that's not the case. Mastering a new language is a long process that requires time, perseverance and daily practice."
      },
      "Q2": {
        "question": "1.2 What is the best age to start learning a foreign language?",
        "answer1": "There is no lower limit. Bilingual children hear a second language from birth and this does not hinder them in any way. On the contrary, it helps them learn later in life.",
        "answer2": "Bilinguals are considered to have a more flexible and non-standard way of thinking, and languages are so easy for them that they don't hesitate to switch from one to the other. They simply choose which language is more appropriate in a given situation.",
        "answer3": "The earlier the child starts hearing a foreign language, accompanied by images and actions (which is how lessons for the very young are taught), the more natural the language learning process will be later on.",
        "answer4": "We offer individual lessons for children from 4 years old and group lessons for children from 5 years old and up."

        "answer1": "Of course, it is!",
        "answer2": "Our teachers work with children as young as 4 years old.With the help of various Zoom features (such as video or music playback, displaying images, interactive screen use), topics are explored in a playful and enjoyable manner. We employ creative and interactive methods that align with the needs and learning behaviours of our youngest participants. Our methods provide children with an intuitive sense of the foreign language as if it were their native tongue, and this happens in a short amount of time.",

      },
      "Q6": {
        "question": "1.6 When will I see the results of my lessons?",
        "answer1": "Learning a foreign language is like learning to drive a car. You cannot get into a car and drive at a high speed straight away; you cannot learn to park your car if you cannot drive forwards and backwards; you cannot be an excellent driver if you do not have daily driving practice and most importantly, if you do not have someone around to logically guide you through the process from the simple to the complex. Now let's look at the same steps, but in relation to learning foreign languages.",
        "answer2": "Many students expect instant results, but that's not the case. Mastering a new language is a long process that requires time, perseverance and daily practice. It is a mistake to think that success depends only on the teacher, not at all, it is a joint, coordinated work of two participants in the process, and success depends equally on both.",
        "answer3": "It is the teacher who can design the learning path that is most suitable and effective for you. Why? Because the teacher knows the language perfectly, knows the grammatical, phonetic or syntactical difficulties in learning the language, and knows the topics that take a long time to learn, be it a few weeks or a month.",
        "answer4": "Often students feel that we are repeating the same thing over and over again, but if they don't get, for example, this or that structure or verb conjugation right, once they move on, they simply won't be able to use it. And this snowball of 'gaps' in the language will start rolling, and one will have to go back to previous topics, wasting both time and finances.",
        "answer5": "Of course, when choosing a particular language school, you have to trust the teachers who will work with you and also trust the teaching methods/methods that are implemented in that school. Teachers are like guides who show you the way, take you by the hand and lead you along the way. But if you keep resisting, pulling your hand away and running in the other direction, will it be  possible to get good results?"

      },
      "Q8": {
        "question": "1.8 What is the duration of the course?",
        "answer1": "It depends on the course programme chosen and the intensity of the lessons (general language course, intensive course, evening course, individual lessons, special courses, children's or teenage courses).",
        "answer2": "There are three language levels, A, B and C. Each of these is subdivided into several sub-levels, e.g. A1.1, A1.2, A2.1. and A2.2, etc.",
        "answer3": "Each course involves the acquisition of one sub-level and takes between one month (in the case of intensive courses) and two to three months (kids & teens courses, adults evening courses).",
        "answer4": "In the case of intensive courses, one sub-level (e.g. A1.1) consists of 80 to 100 teaching hours (teaching hour - 45 minutes); evening courses consist of 45 to 60 teaching hours. In individual classes the material can be completed in approximately 30-40 academic hours. But a lot also depends on the student's motivation and aptitude for learning and doing homework.",

        "question": "1.11 Should a child learn 2 languages at once, e.g. German and English? Or is it too complicated?",
        "answer1": "Children can easily learn several foreign languages at the same time. The younger your child is, the easier and more natural the process is.",
        "answer2": "But even if your child is already in school, they can do it too! The most important thing here is to separate the different languages. For example, the mother speaks French with the child and the father speaks English (if it is a bilingual family). Or if it is a language school, the child has different days and teachers for different languages.",
        "answer3": "At first, your child will need some time to adapt to more than one foreign language, but this is only temporary; after a month, the child will easily learn both languages.",
        "answer4": "Some children may get confused at the beginning, there is nothing wrong with this, it's just the brain working. A child's brain in a specific situation automatically picks the words of the language which are easier and simpler than those which are more difficult and complicated. But again, it is a matter of time, and the distinction between languages is organically formed in the brain.",
        "answer5": "The most important thing for parents to remember is that time is limited and if you want your child to learn foreign languages, you shouldn't put it off. The earlier your child starts to learn foreign languages, the easier it will be."
      },
      "Q12": {
        "question": "1.12 How effective are group classes?",
        "answer1": "Many parents think that group language classes are not as effective as individual classes. But that's not always the case.",
        "answer2": "Variety",
        "answer3": "In a group class, it is very easy to make the lesson dynamic and varied, the teacher being able offer students many different activities and exercises. ",
        "answer4": "This includes group and pair work as well as all kinds of games, competitions, debates and discussions. Such a format of teaching is definitely not boring for a child.",
        "answer5": "Simulation of real life",
        "answer6": "In a group it is much easier to create situations which imitate real life situations and this is one of the basic conditions for successful language acquisition. After all, your child has to use it in practice! It is much easier to act out scenes from everyday life, school or family life if the children do it with other pupils and not with the teacher. It is also important to change communication partners, for example in group work which is easily doable.",
        "answer7": "Competitive spirit",
        "answer8": "We are talking about a healthy, positive rivalry which helps you learn unfamiliar information faster and facilitates effective foreign language learning, especially if the other students in the group are at approximately the same level as your child.",
        "answer9": "Opportunity to learn from others' mistakes",
        "answer10": "When learning a foreign language in a group, the child sees not only his or her own mistakes, but also the mistakes of others.",
        "answer11": "Incorrect pronunciation of sounds, problems with applying new grammar rules, incorrect use of words and phrases - we notice other people's mistakes much more often than we notice our own. And we can learn from them just as effectively as from our own.",
        "answer12": "Group lessons for children are interesting, fun and motivate the child to not fall behind the other children in the group, but to keep up with them!"
      },
      "Q13": {
        "question": "1.13 Why do the lessons for children under 10 last 45 minutes and not 60?",
        "answer1": "Norms for lesson length have been developed based on the age and physiological characteristics of children. For younger students, the lesson should last no longer than 40 minutes and 5 minutes for the introductory part of the lesson and saying goodbye at the end of the class.",
        "answer2": "Experts in age and educational psychology have found that 45 minutes of a lesson provides an opportunity for productive mental activity. During this time, the ability to concentrate and perform complex mental activities reaches its peak.",
        "answer3": "Conventionally speaking, this is questioning, repeating, learning new material and consolidating new material. This is the optimum lesson length for younger pupils, and the format is familiar to them: lessons in school are also 40 minutes long. There are 12-18 different tasks in a lesson like this.",
        "answer4": "We know that children, and adults too, cannot maintain a high level of concentration for long periods of time. The attention curve starts to go down around 15-20 minutes into the lesson and reaches a low point half an hour after the start of the lesson. Then it goes up again briefly - just as the child realises that the end of the lesson is just around the corner.",
        "answer5": "To keep students from getting bored and distracted, our teachers constantly give them tasks that require different types of activity: watch a video and discuss what they have seen, interview a friend, describe your favourite cartoon character, read a mini-comic. During the lesson, the teacher alternates between intellectual and physical activities, helping to maintain attention from the first to the last minute."
      },
      "Q14": {
        "question": "1.14 I think my child is at a higher level than the other children in the group. My child says their classes are too easy.",
        "answer1": "'This level is too easy for my child' - we can often get this kind of feedback from parents after the first lessons.",
        "answer2": "This is the way it should be! After all, it is our common goal (both teacher and parent) to motivate the child to learn a language. Would a child really want to go to a class where everything is very complicated and incomprehensible?! Of course not.",
        "answer3": "We need to enthuse the child, immerse them gently in a foreign language, building on the knowledge they already have, be it colours, animals or counting up to 5. In the lesson, we create a situation of success, of achievement, a small step, but forward! The child has their own motivation 'I am good at it', 'I am praised'.",
        "answer4": "Then we add new vocabulary, grammar and syntactic constructions. The child sometimes doesn't notice it happening as the lesson format is interactive, dynamic and varied in content and form.",
        "answer5": "Many children understand spoken language well, and parents are under the impression that the child knows everything at this level and needs to be transferred to a more complex one. But 'listening comprehension' is only one component of a whole list of competencies that a child should possess at different stages of foreign language acquisition. There are four of them - speaking, listening, reading, writing. If a child develops only one of them, the learning trajectory is built in such a way that the child must  catch up on the other three skills. Once a child has mastered all four skills at their level, then they can move on to the next level.",
        "answer6": "Everyone would agree that learning a language is quite a complex process, and as we immerse ourselves in it, we cannot be limited to a minimum of vocabulary or constructions. For example, your child understands the question, 'How old are you?' and can answer it. It seems to the parent that the topic 'age' has already been explored by the child, because they can answer this question, so they can go on. Yet, this is not quite true.",
        "answer7": "In a foreign language, there can be other, similar questions: 'What is your age?', 'Are you 7 years old?', 'Are you 7 or 8 years old?'. And children are usually lost when they hear new constructions, and this is normal. Therefore, it is the task of our teachers to give all the variety of language forms that exist in a given language, so that a child, when exposed to a foreign language environment, can answer any of the questions above.",
        "answer8": "It is the policy of our language school to impart deep, broad knowledge to children. We are interested in ensuring that students' progress becomes faster from level to level, but without losing the quality of the knowledge gained."

        "answer1": "We use a communicative approach in our lessons, which aims to get the children talking. The focus is on vocabulary and conversation; grammar is not focused on in the children's groups but is learned on a subconscious level through fixed conversational constructions: the children learn under the guidance of the teacher to form sentences, to ask others different types of questions (general, special), to use singular and plural forms, irregular verbs, etc.",

        "answer3": "We also have team games and the children try hard to get points for their team so they don't let their team down.

        "question": "3.16 Why do you need to do your homework and check it with the teacher in class?",
        "answer1": "Homework is a consolidation of the covered material and additional independent language practice, because the more a person is 'in the language', the faster s/he learns it.",
        "answer2": "The results of homework are also an indicator of the level of mastering of the learnt material; if during the homework check the teacher sees a large number of mistakes on the part of students, he or she corrects the lesson plan for the current and future lessons with this factor in mind. Therefore, both doing and checking homework is an indispensable part of learning any foreign language."

Grammar is not thematised in the children's groups, it is learnt on a subconscious level through sustained conversational constructions. Under the guidance of the teacher, the children learn to form sentences, ask others different types of general and specific questions, describe their hobbies, school, room, family, pets and the weather etc.",

        "question": "3.26 Why do teachers sometimes ask children to write down words in class? Aren't printouts or materials in a digital form enough?",
        "answer1": "In each lesson we engage different kinds of memory, including tactile memory in which the children write something (a relatively short part of the lesson, 5-10 minutes, is allocated for this).",
        "answer2": "Yes, we could send printouts, and we do send them when needed and when it serves as a backup to the aims and objectives of the lesson.",
        "answer3": "Nowadays, all children are growing up with gadgets and with the spread of digitalisation, children (both native and non-native speakers) make a lot more spelling mistakes. That's why we write words in class with the children and we also give them homework to practise these words (in print-outs among others) and we occasionally write dictations in class."

        "question": "3.27 My child said that the lesson was boring, a lot of repetition and that only a few phrases were practised during the whole lesson. My child wants more exercises, more assignments and more grammar.",
        "answer1": "Let us explain our methodology and teaching principles so that you understand what lies behind the few phrases we have practised in class. We don't make the children cram anything or write too much since the MultiTaskers method aims at getting the children talking (especially at the beginning levels of language learning).",
        "answer2": "Let's say there are 3 main topics in the lesson: colours, pronouns and contrasts (slow/fast). What is learned in these cases? In parallel, 10-15 new words (objects, means of transport, animals), their characteristics (slow/fast), how to correctly form questions with these words, the structure of narrative and interrogative sentences, verb conjugation.",
        "answer3": "The lesson is structured in a playful, conversational way and we guarantee that at the end of the lesson all the children in the group will have learned the material equally well. When a lesson is taught on many topics at once, it is then necessary to go back over the material again, as the vocabulary and grammar of these topics have not been automatized yet.",
        "answer4": "The desires of a particular student and the pace of learning are easiest to accommodate and adjust during an individual study programme. The student and the parents can express their wishes, but the programme and methods are chosen by the teacher."

      "Q28": {
        "question": "3.28 I think that live interaction with the teacher and the children in a group is better than an online lesson. Can primary school children absorb information online?",
        "answer1": "Of course, online is not a familiar learning format for children, but based on experience we can say it shows that even pre-schoolers adapt well to it and achieve excellent results in language learning. It is a format that might be new for your child and, like everything new, it evokes mixed feelings at first. Your child just needs to adapt to this format! After 2-3 lessons they will understand how to interact with the teacher and learn how to work in this format.",
        "answer2": "Of course, live communication is necessary for everyone, not only younger pupils. If you have such opportunities, that's great! But the online format helps to save time: you do not need to take your child somewhere - turn on the computer and the lesson begins. We are sure that your children have plenty of real communication with their peers, classmates, friends and teachers at school.",
        "answer3": "If you like the teacher and their interaction format and teaching methods in your trial lesson, you can take a trial month of lessons and see how your child progresses in learning and how they react before making a final decision."

        "answer1": "Our methods and principles of teaching and creating an atmosphere in the lesson that is conducive to learning are based on many years of experience. All lessons, the pace of work, the number of corrections are not personal techniques of a particular teacher, but the principles that are followed by all teachers in our school.",
        "answer2": "A1 is one of the most challenging levels for both teachers and students. Especially in the format of evening classes, when you are restricted by the amount of hours in the curriculum and within these limits, the teacher has to be able to teach the most important aspects of the language and be able to make the students feel at ease, overcome their fear of learning, teach them NOT to be afraid of making mistakes, and, even with mistakes at the beginning, teach them to speak and read.",
        "answer3": "German is not the easiest foreign language to learn. When constructing sentences and reading texts and dialogues, mistakes can be made in literally every word, or even in one or more. Would you still be motivated by the end of the lesson if you were corrected several times in one sentence - in grammar, sentence construction and also in the pronunciation of words?",
        "answer4": "There are categories of errors - significant and not so significant (critical and non-critical) at this stage of language learning. The number of corrections depends on the purpose of this stage of the lesson - in this case, it is important for the teacher that all the words are perfectly pronounced by the students, or at this stage we have other aspects of language in focus and priority, such as grammar, syntax (sentence construction), etc. In this instance, we have to 'sacrifice' other aspects of the language, but language learning is a long, time-consuming, multi-faceted process. The syllabus of the course and subsequent courses and modules is structured so that at a certain stage a balance is created and both grammar, listening and pronunciation are aligned."
